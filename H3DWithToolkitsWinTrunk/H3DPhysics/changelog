Changes for version 1.3.0:
- Generated header is moved to CMake build directory and can only be found
 in H3DPhysics/include after INSTALL project has been built.
- Speed optimizations that could affect some compilers.
- Updates to CMake build system to build properly when TortoiseSVN is installed
 but the current H3D build is not a TortoiseSVN checkout.
- Updates to build on MinGW.
- Memory leak fixes.
- Doxygen documentation now links to python documentation as well.
- Fixes to handle sliderJoint better for most physics engines.
- Fixes to CollisionSpace and ODE.
- Changed signature of some callback functions that are never used as callbacks.
 They now have return type void.
- IndexedHexaSet, IndexedTetraSet, IndexedPointSet and IndexedElementSet are now
 more properly implemented and behaves like for example IndexedTriangleSet when
 it comes to colors, normals and texture coordinates.
- The SoftBody node no longer assumes that its geometry is of type IndexedTetraSet
 but accepts all nodes with coord and index field.

New fields:
IndexedTetraSet::renderMode
SliderJoint::sliderForce
- H3DSoftBodyLoader::filename is now H3DSoftBodyLoader::url and is an MField.
  filename can be used a while longer at X3D level. On C++ level it can not.
CollidableShape::clipPlanes
CollisionCollection::collidableExceptionGroups

New nodes:
  CollidableExceptionGroup

Changes for version 1.2.0:
- H3DPhysics additions to H3DAPIs python interface to get utility functions
 in python when using H3DPhysics.
- The package is now called H3DPhysics instead of RigidBodyPhysics.
It contains the X3D RigidBodyPhysics component as well as a well thought
through suggestion for SoftBody capabilities. Of course H3DPhysics offers
haptics capabilities for soft bodies as well.
- New physics engine implemented. PhysX3, still in alpha state.
- New physics engine implemented. SOFA, still in alpha state.
- Fixes to make sure that gravity does not affect scene before all object
are included at startup.
- Support for SoftBodies using Bullet and PhysX. This support is still in beta.
Bullet implementation is fairly stable.
- Improved bullet support. Joint types are now supported with Bullet.

Changes for version 1.0.1:

- Fixed a bug with "fixed" option and ODE.
- RigidBodyPhysics now compiles on 64 bit systems and
  Ubuntu 9.10 and gcc 3.1.1.
- CMake updates.
